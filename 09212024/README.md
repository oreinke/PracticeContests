Easier problem set in total this session, more trivials. Need to practice typing speed; lagging behind on most bangers

Completed 8/10 in competition

num 9 complete after
num 10 in progress

*Look into setting up custom starting doc in VScode. Standard is throwing rte for some reason lol

1 - no notes
2 - get glasses checked. Having issues counting repeating chars
3 - no problem, but may need to get used to usign string builder if this had more cases.
4 - new error; presentation error. Just wrong number of spaces. .trim() is friend
5 - see 2
6 - careful reading. did way too much work for a constraint that i made up in head and assumed. Assumed 0 throws meant you can catch 2, instead its a rest where you take no action AT ALL
7 - may need to look into backtracking quicker. simple dfs problem, but working backwards greatly improved time
8 - BFS problem that just takes time. Need to be more careful on row/col percision
9 - has to be DP. dont know whats up
10 - some math trick. will research.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 - binary search? still haven't done but prof said so
10 - Not math trick, dp involving holding history of 2 iterations. carefully check and re run logic. 2 hours wasted on missed math error.
