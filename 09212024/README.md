Easier problem set in total this session, more trivials. Need to practice typing speed; lagging behind on most bangers

Completed 8/10 in competition

num 9 completed after
num 10 completed after

*Look into setting up custom starting doc in VScode. Standard is throwing rte for some reason lol

1 - no notes
2 - get glasses checked. Having issues counting repeating chars
3 - no problem, but may need to get used to usign string builder if this had more cases.
4 - new error; presentation error. Just wrong number of spaces. .trim() is friend
5 - see 2
6 - careful reading. did way too much work for a constraint that i made up in head and assumed. Assumed 0 throws meant you can catch 2, instead its a rest where you take no action AT ALL
7 - may need to look into backtracking quicker. simple dfs problem, but working backwards greatly improved time
8 - BFS problem that just takes time. Need to be more careful on row/col percision
9 - has to be DP. dont know whats up
10 - some math trick. will research.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 - binary search? still haven't done but prof said so
10 - Not math trick, dp involving holding history of 2 iterations. carefully check and re run logic. 2 hours wasted on missed math error.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 - Interesting method to solve problems. will have to remeber for futures tricky problems. Basically use a educated guess at a realistic number and begin a binary search from that solution, checking the validity of of each guess until high and low are close enough for the exact, 20 whatever decimal point answer to not matter. In this instance, we needed 3 decimals points of precision, so when the diffrence was below .0001 we call it quits
