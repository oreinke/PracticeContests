Overview - Still learning c++, especially maps n iterators, and struggling to read (glasses). Took lots of doc references and syntax, esp on E.
Problems weren't crazy algorithmically, just struggling with implementation currently.
A - Was using double for the distance and then just checking that 2 answers were within .001 of eachother, however we need to
    instead use the pre-sqrt distance and store it in a long for accuracy.
    Also missed the full output specifications, failing to apply an additional cosntraint (min y when newX = bestX).
B - Sliding window problem. need to rememebr to continue processing, even if right hits end of array becuase of problems like this.
C - Easy after key observation that the optimal strategy is just flip all 0 or all 1 segments,
    any alternative strategy will be equivalent or worse. Flipping only half of 1 seg wont make senese,
    and if we flip a series of segs in 1 flip, it at most can flip 2 segs to the correct orientation, 
    as any already corrects segs will need to be corrected. this results in the move to flip + additonal new work, 
    which will be equivalent or worse than our above solution.
D - Prefix sum problem, given an array make a prefix sum of it and find the lowest index with value >= query.
    Used an ordered map in my solution, as i was too lazy to implement a binary search and can't rememeber the C++ for it.
    Missed query = 0 edge case, otherwise had correct sol
